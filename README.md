🚀 Walmart Sales Data Analysis 
🔍 Project Overview
A real-world data analytics project that transforms raw Walmart sales data into meaningful business insights using Python, SQL (MySQL), and VS Code. This project showcases my ability to handle the complete data pipeline — from acquisition and cleaning to SQL-based analysis and interpretation.

📈 Goal: Extract actionable insights to support data-driven decisions for retail sales optimization.

🛠️ Tech Stack
IDE: Visual Studio Code

Language: Python

Database: MySQL

Libraries: pandas, numpy, sqlalchemy, mysql-connector-python

Tools: Kaggle API, Jupyter Notebook

🧩 Project Breakdown
1️⃣ Environment Setup
Initialized a virtual environment in VS Code.

Structured project folders for clean and reproducible development.

2️⃣ Data Collection
Used Kaggle API to download the Walmart Sales dataset.

Stored and managed data in the data/ directory.

3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Removed duplicates and handled missing values.

Fixed data types (e.g., dates, prices) for consistency.

Cleaned and converted currency strings into numerical format.

4️⃣ Feature Engineering
Created a new column Total Amount = Unit Price × Quantity.

Added derived features to support business-level SQL queries.

5️⃣ Database Integration
Connected to MySQL using SQLAlchemy.

Automatically created and populated tables with clean data.

Verified data accuracy with SQL SELECT queries.

6️⃣ Business-Oriented SQL Analysis
Performed deep-dive SQL analytics to answer critical questions:

🔹 Revenue trends across branches and product categories

🔹 Customer payment method preferences

🔹 Peak sales hours and days

🔹 Most profitable locations

🔹 Sales behavior by city and gender

7️⃣ Results & Insights
🏆 Identified the top-performing branches and categories.

🧠 Uncovered customer behavior trends (ratings, timings, preferences).

💡 Provided a data-driven base for future retail strategies.
